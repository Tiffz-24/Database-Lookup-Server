# Database-Lookup-Server
Program which utilizes the sockets API in C to create a TCP server that recieves a lookup string from a client, searches a database of records stored in structs for matching words, and sends the results to the client. Also contains linked list methods that were implemented in order to load the records into memory so that they could be read.
